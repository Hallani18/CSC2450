##Try It Out Week 2
This is the exercise we did at the end of class on 9/7. I've uploaded the PDF with all the questions / answers and a Java Project that shows you how they're evaluated within Eclipse.

To Run the Java code:

1. Download the Try It Out folder. 
2. Open Eclipse, click File -> Open Project from File System
3. Change your Import Source to the location of your Try It Out folder. 
4. Once you select your destination, you should see the folder name followed by Import As: Eclipse Project.
5. Click Finish

You should now see your Folder within Package/Project Explorer. Within that folder will be two sub-folders:  bin and src. Expand the src folder and double-click TryItOutWeek2.java to open it in your editor. Click the Green Run button to see it run.

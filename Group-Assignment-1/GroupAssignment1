Group Assignment #1:

Four teams: each team is whatever folder color you have.

You will have the rest of classtime to finish.

When you are done, add your file to your group's folder. 

You should be able to click "Upload Files" then drag/drop your project folder onto the screen. 

Make sure your folder has your team name.
